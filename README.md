## Features 
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

## To-Do 
Nothing specific currently.

## How to use it
If just want to have fresh start and play around with LaTeX, I can recommend 
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX and Rich Text collaborative writing and publishing tool. 
(Like Google docs, if you will). No need to install something, just dive into it. :)

### Prerequisites
LaTeX is free software and does not require a sophisticated computer system to run. 
You just need a Mac, Linux or Windows based machine. Or just a HTML5 capable webrowser if you use a
cloud based solution like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

### Setup
Mac, Linux and Windows: just visit <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">latex-project.org/get</a>
If you work on a windwos based machine, I can recommend to use [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) as your LaTeX basis.
I had some package downloading problems with [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) but it is really up to you which system you prefer for whatsoever reason. Mac users are covered by [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/).

### Running
You can use LaTeX stand-alone within a terminal to just compile your documents or just grab one of the powerful LaTeX IDEs such as
[TeX Studio](http://www.texstudio.org/), [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), [TexWorks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/). 
You may also take a look at: [Comparison of TeX Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors).
There are support plugins for [Vim](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/) and [Emacs](https://piotrkazmierczak.com/2010/emacs-as-the-ultimate-latex-editor/). 

I use TexStudio on a Windows based system. 
On Mac OS I often just compile my documents within the terminal.
